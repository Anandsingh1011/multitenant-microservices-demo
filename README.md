# Full Isolation in Multi-Tenant SaaS with Kubernetes + Istio

This is the repository of the deployemnt I used for my DevOpsDays Jakarta 2019 talk about Full Isolation in Multi-Tenant SaaS with Kubernetes + Istio.
The repository uses microservices from https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo, I am very greatful that GCP team manage to build and share such comprehensive working demo of microservices.

In the talk I was talking about different architecture approach in multi tenancy SaaS, trade offs between each architecture.
Briefly talk about Kubernetes and Istio, and afterwards talk about how it lowers the barrier in creating the most complex multi-tenancy setup, full isolation which offers the highest isolation between tenants. 
With which the SaaS provider can offer the highest security and data privacy between tenants, The setup would also be the best approach both when the business scales or disaster happens. 

I will add more documentation once I am done preparing the talk material, but for now enjoy the repo hope you find something useful!
